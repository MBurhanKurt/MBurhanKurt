   I graduated from gazi University sociology department in 2019 and in 2020 i started to study master, The Data Science and Business Analytics Programme at the Faculty of Economic Sciences, University of Warsaw .While studying sociology, I realized that the information related to societies was obtained from the data and observation. I processed information about people and society into the computer while studying sociology. After that, my interest in computer technologies increased and I carried out some projects when I received more consistent results than my friends who interpreted their data themselves. After that i started to interest data science.
Data science combines different scientific methods to extract information from data. The Data Science is a rapidly extending part of quantitative analysis, that is highly demanded at the market. Its popularity reflects availability of vast amount of (big) data that used appropriately gives great opportunities for business life.
Before I stepped into professional business life. In my student life; I set goals for myself to gain; living with plans, discipline, self-confidence and self-discipline. I gained a fast and result oriented work discipline. In the project competitions and project tasks; I developed my presentation and research skills by learning how to create, manage and present projects. I developed my personal communication skills in the social organizations and in the organization companies I worked in. During my studies, I prepared part-time studies and prepared myself for the business world.
